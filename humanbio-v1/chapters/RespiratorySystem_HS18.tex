According to the summarized cell respiration, every cell of an \emph{aerobic} organism requires oxygen (\ce{O2}). Complete the equation:  \ce{C6H12O6} + \gap{\ce{ 6 O2 ~ ->~ 6 H2O + 6 CO2}}

\subsection{Myoglobin, Hemoglobin,  \ce{O2}-dissociation curves}
Myoglobin consists of one polypeptide chain and one hem group.
Myoglobin binds  \ce{O2} in the muscle. Myoglobin makes muscles red.
Hemoglobin consists of four polypeptide chains and four hem groups.
Hemoglobin binds  \ce{O2} in the blood. Hemoglobin makes blood red.

The hemoglobin molecule is shown in \ding{229} Starr  Figure 35.15: four subgroups can be identified, two in blue and two in green and four hem groups, shown in red. Each protein chain forms a pocket big enough to store one molecule of  \ce{O2}, thus the four protein chains can bind four  \ce{O2} molecules.

% 	         \label{fig:HemoglobinCooperation} }

 Hemoglobin is found in two different states - the oxygenated (found in "`oxy blood"') and the deoxygenated (present in "`deoxy"' blood) condition. Biochemically this is well understood:

 In \emph{deoxy-hb} all four sub units are very close together and form a tight block due to ionic forces (\textit{like what keeps salt molecules together}). This form is called \emph{tight} and abbreviated as \textbf{T}-form.

 In \emph{oxy-hb} one or more of the sub units carry a  \ce{O2}-molecule. As soon as the first  \ce{O2}-molecule binds to the hemoglobin, the four subunits move apart a little bit, making it easier for the second, third and fourth  \ce{O2}-molecule to bind at the remaining sub units. Under this circumstance the hemoglobin molecule seems to be \emph{relaxed}, therefore it is called \textbf{R-}form (see figure \ref{fig:HemoglobinCooperation}). Due to this irregularity in  \ce{O2}-affinity, the resulting   \ce{O2}-dissociation curve is \textbf{S-shaped} instead of being linear (see figure \ref{fig:HbAffinitaetskurve}).

	 \item Read again figure \ref{fig:O2andCO2Ery} and explain why the blood pH falls from 7.4 at the beginning of the systemic capillaries to pH 7.2 at the start of the  systemic veins (see  \ding{229} Starr figure 35.14 for systemic capillaries and veins).\\
		 \Loesung{Active cells give off  \ce{CO2} which reacts with water to  \ce{HCO3-} and  \ce{H+}. The  \ce{H+} is a so called ``acid particle'' - the more there is, the lower the pH reads.

%
% A close look at figure \ref{fig:O2andCO2Ery} reveals the release of one  \ce{H+} for the production of each  \ce{HCO3-} from  \ce{CO2 + H2O} and an arrow bringing this  \ce{H+} to \textit{Hemoglobin}. There is a close link of this chemical process to the  \ce{O2}-dissociation curve of hemoglobin:
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item each  \ce{H+} forms in water a  \ce{H3O+}
%  \item every  \ce{H3O+} lowers the pH, low pH is "`acidic"'
%  \item in the body tissue the pH \gap{sinks} due to \gap{CO2} given off from the tissue
%  \item in the lungs the pH \gap{rises} due to \gap{CO2} taken away by the lungs
%  \item the lower the pH, the \gap{lower} the affinity of hemoglobin for  \gap{\ce{O2}}
%  \item the higher the pH, the \gap{higher} the affinity of hemoglobin for \gap{\ce{O2}}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1.5em, leftmargin=*]
\item  In addition to the number of  \ce{O2}-molecules bound to Hb and the pH value, a third factor controls the affinity of hemoglobin for  \ce{O2}: the chemical substance di-phospho-glycerol (DPG).

The \textit{pregnant mom} depicts the  \ce{O2}-dissociation curve of a mother's blood (= an adult body). The \textit{baby} depicts the  \ce{O2}-dissociation curve of a fetus' blood inside a mother's whomb. Now explain the effect of the different concentrations of DPG present in the fetal hemoglobin (Hb\textsubscript{f}) compared to DPG present in the adult hemoglobin (Hb\textsubscript{a})!
