\section{Digestive System} \label{sec:DigestSyst} 
  We eat up to one ton of food yearly (\url{http://www.livescience.com/18070-food-americans-eat-year-infographic.html}).
	 	\marginline{\bgroup  \ttfamily There is an animation about the human digestive system on  \textsc{moodle} \egroup\\ \centering \includegraphics[width=2cm]{/share/SB_Unterricht/moodle-QR-code.png}. }
 Even if we restrict our diet, lets say to 500 kg, this remains a huge figure, approx. eight times your body weight. How does our digestive system cope with this regular load of food? Find this answer and learn even more about the \textsc{digestive system} with help of  \ding{229} \textsc{Starr} and \Forward \textsc{moodle}!

The food processing begins with ripping and crushing food, using a beak, like birds, or teeths, like other vertebrates.

Within the mouth food is formed into a ball, a so called \textbf{bolus} by aid of the tongue and saliva. The subsequent step, \emph{swallowing}
		\marginline{the process of swallowing may be observed by X-rays - see \textsc{moodle} for the link to  \hrefL{/share/SB_Unterricht/Biologie/hum01_VerdauungErnaehrung/WegDerNahrung_PUZZLE/Roentgen_Aufnahme-_Schluckakt.mp4}{https://www.dropbox.com/s/fw7rlr5t8pp3ja9/Roentgen_Aufnahme-_Schluckakt.mp4?dl=0}{swallowing in an x-ray}}

		\item On its way through the alimentary canal, food is split in nutrients which are taken up and waste which is not usable to the body. Study chapter 36.3 - 36.6 in Starr (9ed) and take notes next to the different stations of the alimentary canal shown on the following double-page!
		\end{enumerate}

\emph{Hint:} The digestion of food through enzymatic cleavage will later be discussed in details (see chapter \ref{sec:Enzymes}, page \pageref{sec:Enzymes}).

This is \textbf{self-learning unit:} Work in groups; ask the teacher if you encounter problems or in case of uncertainty what to learn / not to learn.

For the \textbf{correction}s: only FOUR variants of the double-page "`alimentary canal"' will be corrected by the teacher - thus you must work in groups and ensure to spread the teacher's feedback back to all members of your group; due-date to hand in your solution is \textbf{January 15th 2019}.
